# PCIE x1 to MXM 3.0 Adapter

This adapter card is the most basic one, and includes one HDMI output.
This card is designed to be compact and takes up 100x100mm for inexpensive
PCB fabrication. It has a total of one PCI-e lane and contains basic features.

## What can I use this for?

This card is cheap and small, making it great for testing out and flashing MXM Video Cards.
You can also use it as a video adapter in a machine that needs one, like a server or theater PC.
This card will fit in a full height slot, but not a half height slot.

## Technical Specification

- MXM Type: Version 3 Type A card (Size B may work but there may not be enough power)
- HDMI: 1 Type A port (Should support up to HDMI 2.0)
- Power: Maximum of 25W over PCIE connector as per specification, but actual maximum value may be more or less depending on the motherboard.
- PCB: 4 Layer, 1.6mm Thick, 100x100mm in size. (For JLCPCB Fabrication, use Stackup JLC-2313)
