Creating voltage/current data
Unphysical voltage drop on IO side! Possible reasons:
  - the DC path of the power/ground system is not closed due to missing or undefined components;
  - the resistance Rpath of the DC path might be too large due to components with high resistances;
  - the current Iic drawn by the ICs is too large or the voltage 'Usupply' of the power supply is too small;
  - the condition 'Usupply > Rpath*Iic' for a working power/ground system is not fulfilled;
